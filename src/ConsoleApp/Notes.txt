TODO:
Validate separator and DateFormat.
Fix file reading to be unix compatible.
Use date time offset converted from France DateTime in ShippingEntry.Date.
Use ShippingEntry.PackageSize as enum instead of string.
Use ShippingEntry.ShippingProvider as enum.
Protect ShippingEntry type better.
Use Monads to parse lines.
Implement Linq to file parser for lazy loading.
Implement custome deserializer and use it for file parsing.
Force sequential execution for Acceptance tests.

Some of the architecture notes.
# Decided against async methods, because if I use async for reading the file, then I loose the Ienumerable<> interface,
	and if I use the async only on the output part of the method it does not save much, because this is the last step, 
	and no other processes/calculations of the program should be happening then. So all in all it would just be an 
	unnecessary code complication.
#selfnote. injecting pure data into class aint such a bad idea. For pure functions.(?)
